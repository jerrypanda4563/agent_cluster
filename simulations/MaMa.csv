However, there should be thorough verification and monitoring to ensure the safety and well being of the elders. Trustees of the platform should also consider accommodating the elders' preferences and comfort."

Additionally, I worry about potential communication problems, given the considerable age difference. However, I am open to witnessing the potential benefits this system could bring, such as a fresh perspective and a vibrant energy."
